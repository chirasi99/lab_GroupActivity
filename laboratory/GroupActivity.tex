\section{First Generation Computer} 
Generations timeline - 1940s 1950s \\ 
Evolving hardware - Vacuum tubes based \\ 
Vacuum tube - an electroic gadget that controls the progression of electrons in a vacuum utilized as a switch, intensifier, or show screen in numerous more established model radios, Televisions, PCs, and so on.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Main electronic component - Vacuum tube
\item Main memory - magnetic drums and magnetic tapes
\item Programming language - machine language
\item Power - consume a lot of electricity and generate a lot of heat.
\item Speed and size- very slow and very large in size (often taking up entire room)
\item Input/output devices- punched cards and paper tape.
\item Esxsiamples- ENIAC,UNIVAC1, IBM 650, IBM 701, etc..
\item Quantity - there were about 100 different vacuum tube computers produced between 1942 and 1963.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Advantages} \\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item It utilized vacuum tubes which are the solitary electronic part accessible during the those days.
\item These PCs could compute in milliseconds.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item These were extremely large in size, weight was around 30 tones.
\item These PCs depended on vacuum tubes
\item These PCs were expensive.
\item It could store just a limited quantity of data because of the presence of attractive drums.
\item As the innovation of original PCs includes vacuum tubes, so another disservice of these PCs was, vaccum tubes require a huge cooling framework.
\item Less work effectiveness.
\item Restricted programming abilities and punch cards were utilized to take input.
\item Huge measure of energy utilization.
\item Not solid and consistent support is required.
\end{itemize}
